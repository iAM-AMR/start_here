# About GitHub

If it's your first time here, welcome!  

This is [GitHub](https://github.com/), a service that hosts files (like Dropbox, Google Drive, or iCloud), and provides version control using Git. Specifically, this is the iAM.AMR project's *start_here* GitHub repository -- kind of like the welcome mat to our home on GitHub.

If you'd like to get to know more about Git and GitHub (which we strongly encourage), we suggest:

- the [documentation](https://docs.iam.amr.pub)
- GitHub's [Hello World Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), a 10 minute how-to that will walk you through creating your own repository (repo) on GitHub
- GitHub's [Introductory Course](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github), a free course on GitHub that will take less than one hour to complete

## Navigating GitHub and Downloading Files

### GitHub

One of the best places to start is the [iAM.AMR Organization](https://github.com/iAM-AMR)'s page (it's probably how you got here!). All project repos are listed there, and links to important repos are pinned to the top of the page. Very briefly;

- GitHub seperates sub-projects into repositories or *repos*
- Every *repo* has a *README.md*
  - a *repo* is basically a folder
  - the README is automatically displayed when you open the *repo* on GitHub
  - READMEs are only shown for the top two levels of the *repo*
- the crumb at the top of the page will take you back to the iAM.AMR Organization's page
- this repo contains links to project and model directories


### Downloading Files

A **release** is a snapshot of a repository at a specific, notable moment in time, usually after new features are added and ready for general consumption.

You should always check the repo for a recent release where available, as it may be the most stable version of the repo's contents.

#### Download Directly

The simplest way to get started is to download the entire repository as a ZIP file. Download a release (preferred; on the right hand side of the window), or use the green `CODE` button to download the current, main-branch copy.

#### Clone

Use a GitHub Desktop client (like [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.iam.amr.pub/en/latest/09_technology/git.html) or [Source Tree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)).




To download files:

- download the latest **release**
- use the BIG GREEN BUTTON
- clone the repo to your computer

 **Always Check for a Release.** 


- readmes are shown automatically for the first two levels
- repos are like folders (sorted by activity)

### Downloading Files

- Use the big green button
- In some cases, download releases (we should use a badge for this! not a live one, but a static one)
