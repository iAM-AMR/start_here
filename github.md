# About GitHub



## First Time?

If it's your first time here, welcome! This is the iAM.AMR project's GitHub, and you're reading the README of the **start_here** repo. If none of that made sense to you, you're in the right place. 


## A Brief Introduction to GitHub

### Navigation

- readmes are shown automatically for the first two levels
- the crumb at the top will take you back to the main iAM.AMR page
- repos are like folders (sorted by activity)



### Downloading Files

- Use the big green button
- In some cases, download releases (we should use a badge for this! not a live one, but a static one)
