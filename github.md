# About GitHub

If it's your first time here, welcome! This is GitHub, a service that hosts files (like Dropbox, Google Drive, or iCloud), and provides version control using Git. Specifically, this is the iAM.AMR project's *start_here* GitHub repository -- kind of like the welcome mat to our home on GitHub.

If you'd like to get to know more about Git and GitHub (which we strongly encourage), we suggest:

- reading our documentation
- GitHub's [Hello World Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), a 10 minute how-to that will walk you through creating your own repository (repo) on GitHub
- GitHub's [Introductory Course](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github), a free course on GitHub that will take less than one hour to complete

For the bare minimum you'll need to get around, see *Navigation* below.

## Navigation

- readmes are shown automatically for the first two levels
- the crumb at the top will take you back to the main iAM.AMR page
- repos are like folders (sorted by activity)

### Downloading Files

- Use the big green button
- In some cases, download releases (we should use a badge for this! not a live one, but a static one)
