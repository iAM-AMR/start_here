# Welcome

Welcome to the iAM.AMR project's GitHub!

The [Team Repo](https://github.com/iAM-AMR/team).


## First Time?

If it's your first time here, welcome! This is the iAM.AMR project's GitHub, and you're reading the README of the **start_here** repo. If none of that made sense to you, you're in the right place. 


## A Brief Introduction to GitHub

### Navigation

- readmes are shown automatically for the first two levels
- the crumb at the top will take you back to the main iAM.AMR page
- repos are like folders (sorted by activity)



### Downloading Files

- Use the big green button
- In some cases, download releases (we should use a badge for this! not a live one, but a static one)



## Directory

- [Documentation](https://goto.iam.amr.pub/docs)
- link to each repo with a description (maybe in table format?)
  - should it just be the description in GitHub?
