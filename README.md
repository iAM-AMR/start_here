# Welcome to the iAM.AMR Project!

This README acts as a public landing page for the iAM.AMR project's new collaborators and visitors.

## Get Started

If this is your first time using GitHub, see our brief [GitHub Guide](github.md). 

### Public Links

- the iAM.AMR Project [Documentation](https://goto.iam.amr.pub/docs)
- the [model directory](https://github.com/iAM-AMR/models)

### Team (Private) Links

You must be signed into your GitHub account and authorized to access the iAM.AMR organization.

- the [team repo](https://github.com/iAM-AMR/team)
- the [model directory](https://github.com/iAM-AMR/models)
- the [project directory](https://github.com/iAM-AMR/team/blob/main/directory.md)

If you see a 404 page:

- the iAM.AMR/team repo is only accessible to collaborators
  - you must create a GitHub account, and request access from @chapb
- if you've already created a GitHub account and requested access:
  1. ensure you are logged in to the account
  1. ensure you have given time (24h) to process the request
  1. ensure you have accepted the invitation from your email, or from [here](https://github.com/iam-amr/invitations)
- if you're still having trouble accessing the iAM.AMR team, contact @chapb.
- the link may just actually be broken...
