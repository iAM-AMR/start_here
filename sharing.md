## Information Sharing

When working on a large project like the iAM.AMR, it can be difficult to determine what information is public, what is private, what is shared with the team, and what should be shared on a need-to-know basis -- either because the data are valuable intellectual property (we hope - says the grad students), or more commonly because the data are preliminary in nature.

We've decided to use the **Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)** to try and make information sharing easier.


### Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)

The [Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_Light_Protocol) was created by the UK's [Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure](https://www.cpni.gov.uk/) in order to facilitate greater sharing of information, and has been adopted by organizations like the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.us-cert.gov/tlp) to indicate to collaborators when and how to share sensitive information. We've adapted the protocol here for the academic context -- for more help, see [FIRST](https://www.first.org/tlp/).


#### <a name="share-yours"></a> Sharing **Your** Information

When you want to indicate how widely information may be shared, you include one of the four **TLP LEVELS** in the format **TLP:COLOUR** in the subject of your email, or while describing a shared file. Even better, include it in the file name so the recipients can't forget!

e.g. my_lifes_work_cash_money_bitcoin_wallet_TLPRED.xlsx     


#### <a name="share-mine"></a> Sharing/Using **Others'** Information

When you want to share others' information (or include others' information in your own work) you check the **TLP:COLOUR** in the GitHub repo, the folder contents, or file name and:

- if that level prohibits use, you ask the owners' explicit permission to use/share it.
- if that level permits use, you use/share it responsibly, and **give attribution**.
- if you can't determine the specified level (or unambiguously infer a level -- see below) you ask the owner.

|  TLP:RED ![TLP Level Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/TLP-RED-red)   | Not for   disclosure, restricted to participants only.           | When information   cannot be effectively acted upon by additional parties, and could lead to   impacts on a party's privacy, reputation, or operations if misused.        > e.g. personally identifiable information, early manuscripts,   unpublished works         | Recipients may   not share TLP:RED information with any parties outside of the specific   exchange, meeting, or conversation in which it was originally disclosed.                                                                                               |
|  TLP:AMBER ![TLP Level Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/TLP-AMBER-yellow) | Limited   disclosure, restricted to participantsâ€™ organizations. | When   information requires support to be effectively acted upon, and carries risks   to privacy, reputation, or operations if shared outside of the organizations   involved.      > e.g. unfinished models, raw datasets, internal communications, meeting   notes | Recipients   may only share TLP:AMBER information with members of the iAM.AMR team. This   is the default level for all information stored in the iAM.AMR GitHub   repository (and other private repos).                                                         |

Care should be taken to highlight the preliminary nature of any conclusions not reviewed by the wider team. |
|  TLP:WHITE ![TLP Level Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/TLP-WHITE-lightgrey) | Disclosure is   encouraged!                                      | When   information has been released to the public.      > e.g. peer-reviewed publications, external presentations                                                                                                                                                   | Subject   to standard copyright rules, TLP:WHITE information may be distributed without   restriction.                                                                                                                                                           |


#### Default and Contextual Levels

If you don't include a **TLP LEVEL**, one may be otherwise inferred by context.

By default, anything shared in an iAM.AMR group forum accessible only to the team (e.g. team-public Slack channel, Dropbox, Google Drive, private GitHub Repo) is **TLP:AMBER**. It should not be shared outside of the team.

By default, anything shared in a forum accessible to the world (e.g. the documentation site, student presentations, posters) is **TLP:GREEN**. It is accessible to the world, with the understanding that the results may be preliminary and not yet published.

By default, any peer-reviewed paper is **TLP:WHITE**. Use it, cite it, tweet it, just beat it -- the world is your oyster. And like anything TLP:WHITE, these are public-facing data or resources that should be disclosed and shared widely!


### Beyond the TLP

Can I be more specific in my sharing? Of course! The TLP is a general framework for information sharing, and you are free to specify additional limitations, or different TLP levels for different use-cases. Or, eschew the TLP all together! But recognize that the more you make strange, one-off exceptions, the more likely a mistake may happen.

As an example, consider the CEDAR database. While the data in aggregate is **TLP:AMBER** until a paper is published (wherein it becomes **TLP:WHITE**), the subsets of data included in each model may be **TLP:GREEN** and later **TLP:WHITE** independent of the whole of CEDAR.
