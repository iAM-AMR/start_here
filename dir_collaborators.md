# For New Team Members

### [Access iAM.AMR/team](https://github.com/iAM-AMR/team)

### [Access iAM.AMR/team](https://github.com/iAM-AMR/team) doesn't work for me ...

I'm seeing a 404 page:

- the iAM.AMR/team repo is only accessible to collaborators
  - you must create a GitHub account, and request access from @chapb
- if you've already created a GitHub account and requested access:
  1. ensure you are logged in to the account
  1. ensure you have given time (24h) to process the request
  1. ensure you have accepted the invitation from your email, or from [here](https://github.com/iam-amr/invitations)
- if you're still having trouble accessing the iAM.AMR team, contact @chapb.
